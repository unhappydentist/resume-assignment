Hello, this is a readme for the website troubleshooting portion of the HTML section.

This will take place in three sections for each page of the website.

We are creating a webpage for our clients called FakeBook, the world's largest fake gold (pyrite) marketplace. 

They have given us different acceptance criteria (fancy tech term for requirements) which we
will need to make sure have been met. 
We will start off with the home page, some criteria may have been met.
Those criteria that haven't been met should be fixed if possible.

Home Page Acceptance Criteria
AC.1 A title in the top left of the page which displays Fakebook in a fantasy font 

AC.2 A centered picture of fake gold (pyrite) with a pixel size of 300 X 400

AC.3 The background color should be cadetblue

AC.4  There should be a paragraph tag which contains a quick description of the company provided below
        "Welcome to FakeBook - Where Every Fool Finds Their Gold! Dive into our sparkling collection of pyrite, the 'fool's gold' that's rich in charm and humor. Whether you're a mineral enthusiast or just looking for a witty gift, our site gleams with laughter and luster. From shiny nuggets to gleaming spheres, we've got pyrite galore to add a touch of sparkle to your life. Don't wait to strike gold - shop now and let the laughter begin!"

AC.5 A navbar directly about the picture which has links for the Login and Search pages. 
        When you click the links they should change to that page

Now these criteria are for the home page, but keep them in mind when going through the next pages to make sure
we keep the website uniform.
